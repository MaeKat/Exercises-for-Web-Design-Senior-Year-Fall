<h1>This is Crazy</h1>
	<p>This is a crazy bad webpage. Some people really need to learn to code their HTML properly.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>There are other programs you can use <strong> other than</strong> Notepad. We just try to use something easy for learning the basics. We'll use cooler stuff later on. And, hopefully you'll know "good code" by then. </p>

<em>Bad HTML coders</em>
	<ul>
	<li>Don't close tags</li>
	<li>Misspell stuff</li>
	<li>Get on my nerves</li>
	</ul>

<p>Now you know. Knowing is half the battle.</p>

<em>Top reasons to learn code first:</em>
<ol>
<li> You are just smarter than the average bear</li>
<li> You will do better in Web Design</li>
<li> Using any other program to design web pages will just be easier</li>
</ol>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>Hope all errors are fixed!</p>
