		<p>In this film <b>Dorothy</b> and her dog <b>Toto</b> are caught in a tornado's path and somehow end up in the Land of Oz. 
		Here she meets some memorable friends and <b>foes</b> in her journey to meet the <b>Wizard of Oz</b> who everyone says can help her return home and possibly grant her new friends their goals of a brain, heart, and courage. 
		Here are some interesting words used in the film:</p>
