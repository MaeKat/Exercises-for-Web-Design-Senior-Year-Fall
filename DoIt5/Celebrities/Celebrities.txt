			<div class = "name-tag"> Leonardo DiCaprio </div>
			<img class = "celeb-image" src = "images/leo.jpg" width:"329px" height:"330px" alt = "Picture of Leonardo DiCaprio" vspace = "20" hspace = "20" align = "right"> 
			<div class = "celeb text">

			Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. 
			DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains (1985) and 
			low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in 
			movies such as Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally 
			renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.

			Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (n�e Indenbirken)
 			and former comic book artist 'George DiCaprio'. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German and Russian 
			ancestry. His middle name, "Wilhelm", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of 
			cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semiautobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar',
			a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to
 			perform under the stage name "Lenny Williams", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.

			DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne 
			(1988) and The New Lassie (1989), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3
 			(1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit 
			sitcom Growing Pains (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the "Cousin Oliver" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint
 			on Growing Pains (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the show
			 ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.

			Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in What's Eating Gilbert 
			Grape (1993), a young gunslinger in The Quick and the Dead (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, "Jim Carroll", in The Basketball
 			Diaries (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation
 			as an actor, it wasn't until his role as "Romeo" in Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following
 			year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time,
 			Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997),
 			DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) and the lo			w-budget The Beach (2000) being
			 some of his few notable roles during this period.

			In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York 
			(2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie
 			stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively
 			involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the 
			natural environment. As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of 
			the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading
			 all-star casts in action thrillers such as The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010), DiCaprio continues to
			 wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliche about actors.

			In 2012, he played a mustache-twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby 
			in The Great Gatsby (2013).

			DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in
			 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.

			Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin has been the President of Russia since 7 May 2012, succeeding Dmitry Medvedev.
			 Putin previously served as President from 2000 to 2008, and as Prime Minister of Russia from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 
			to 2012. During his last term as Prime Minister, he was also the Chairman of United Russia, the ruling party.

			For 16 years Putin was an officer in the KGB, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before he retired to enter politics in his
 			native Saint Petersburg in 1991. He moved to Moscow in 1996 and joined President Boris Yeltsin's administration where he rose quickly,
			 becoming Acting President on 31 December 1999 when Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned. Putin won the subsequent 2000 presidential election, despite 
			widespread accusations of vote-rigging,[3] and was reelected in 2004. Because of constitutionally mandated term limits, Putin was ineligible to run for
 			a third consecutive presidential term in 2008. Dmitry Medvedev won the 2008 presidential election and appointed Putin as Prime Minister, beginning a 
			period of so-called "tandemocracy".[4] In September 2011, following a change in the law extending the presidential term from four years to six,[5]
			 Putin announced that he would seek a third, non-consecutive term as President in the 2012 presidential election, an announcement which led to
			 large-scale protests in many Russian cities. In March 2012 he won the election, which was criticized for procedural irregularities, and is
 			serving a six-year term.[6][7]

			During Putin's first premiership and presidency (1999�2008) real incomes in Russia rose by a factor of 2.5, while real wages more than
 			tripled; unemployment and poverty more than halved. Russians' self-assessed life satisfaction also rose significantly.[8] Putin's first
 			presidency was marked by high economic growth: the Russian economy grew for eight straight years, seeing GDP increase by 72% in PPP 
			(as for nominal GDP, 600%).[8][9][10][11][12] This growth was a combined result of the 2000s commodities boom, high oil prices, as well 
			as prudent economic and fiscal policies.[13][14]

			As Russia's president, Putin and the Federal Assembly passed into law a flat income tax of 13%, a reduced profits tax, and new land and 
			legal codes.[15][16] As Prime Minister, Putin oversaw large-scale military and police reform. His energy policy has affirmed Russia's position
			 as an energy superpower.[17][18] Putin supported high-tech industries such as the nuclear and defence industries. A rise in foreign investment
			[19] contributed to a boom in such sectors as the automotive industry.

			Many of Putin's actions are regarded by the domestic opposition and foreign observers as undemocratic.[20] The 2011 Democracy Index stated
			 that Russia was in "a long process of regression [that] culminated in a move from a hybrid to an authoritarian regime" in view of Putin's 
			candidacy and flawed parliamentary elections.[21] In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8 group as a result of its annexation of Crimea.[22][23]

			Bernard "Bernie" Sanders (born September 8, 1941) is an American politician and the junior United States Senator from Vermont.
 			The longest-serving independent in U.S. Congressional history, Sanders caucuses with the Democratic Party and has been the ranking minority member on
 			the Senate Budget Committee since January 2015.[3] He is a candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

			Sanders was born and raised in the borough of Brooklyn, in New York City. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, Sanders 
			was a member of the Young People's Socialist League and an active Civil Rights protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student
			 Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.[4][5] In 1963, he participated in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. After settling in Vermont in 1968,
			 Sanders ran unsuccessful third-party campaigns for governor and U.S. senator in the early to mid-1970s. As an independent, he was elected mayor of Burlington,
			 Vermont's most populous city, in 1981. He was reelected three times before being elected to represent Vermont's at-large congressional district in the 
			United States House of Representatives in 1990. He served as a congressman for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. In 2012, he was
			reelected by a large margin, capturing almost 71% of the popular vote.

			A self-described democratic socialist,[10] Sanders favors policies similar to those of social democratic parties in Europe, particularly those instituted
			 by the Nordic countries.[14] Sanders is known as a leading progressive voice on issues such as income inequality,[7] universal healthcare, parental leave,
			 climate change,[15] LGBT rights, and campaign finance reform.[16] He rose to national prominence following his 2010 filibuster[17][18] against the proposed
 			extension of the Bush tax cuts. He is also outspoken on civil rights and civil liberties, and has been particularly critical of mass surveillance policies
 			such as the USA PATRIOT Act,[19] the NSA surveillance program,[20] and racial discrimination in the criminal justice system. He has long been critical of
 			U.S. foreign policy, and was an early and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War.

			<div>

			Angela Dorothea Merkel[a] (born 17 July 1954) is a German politician and former research scientist who has been the Chancellor
 			of Germany since 2005 and the Leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since 2000. She is the first woman to hold either office.[7]

			Having earned a doctorate as a physical chemist, Merkel entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, briefly 
			serving as a deputy spokesperson for the first democratically elected East German Government in 1990. Following German reunification in 1990, she
 			was elected to the Bundestag for Stralsund-Nordvorpommern-R�gen in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a seat she has held ever since. She was 
			later appointed as the Minister for Women and Youth in 1991 under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, later becoming the Minister for the Environment in 1994. 
			After Kohl was defeated in 1998, she was elected Secretary-General of the CDU before becoming the party's first female leader two years later in the
			 aftermath of a donations scandal that toppled Wolfgang Sch�uble.

			Following the 2005 federal election, she was appointed Germany's first female Chancellor at the head of a grand coalition
 			consisting of the CDU, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In the 2009 federal 
			election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote and Merkel was able to form a coalition government with the support of the Free Democratic Party 
			(FDP).[8] At the 2013 federal election, Merkel won a landslide victory with 41.5% of the vote, falling just short of an overall majority, and formed a
 			second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag.[9]

			In 2007, Merkel was President of the European Council and chaired the G8, the second woman to do so. She played a central
 			role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. One of her priorities was also to strengthen transatlantic economic 
			relations by signing the agreement for the Transatlantic Economic Council on 30 April 2007. Merkel was seen as having played a crucial role in managing
			 the financial crisis at the European and international level, and has been referred to as "the decider."[10] In domestic policy, health care reform
 			and problems concerning future energy development have been major issues during her Chancellorship.

			Merkel has been described as the de facto leader of the European Union, and was ranked as the world's second most powerful 
			person by Forbes magazine in 2012, the highest ranking ever achieved by a woman; she is currently ranked fifth.[11][12][13][14][15][16] On 26 March 2014,
			 she became the longest-serving incumbent head of government in the European Union. Merkel is currently the Senior G7 leader. In May 2015, she was 
			named the most powerful woman in the world for a record ninth time by Forbes.[17]
